The easiest way to contribute to CamFlow is by submitting issues to suggest improvements or report bugs. When reporting a bug, please specify the version of CamFlow you are running and your Linux distribution. To contribute a new feature, please fork the repository of the component you wish to improve, and submit a pull request against the dev branch. The pull request must pass the continuous integration test before it can be merged.
